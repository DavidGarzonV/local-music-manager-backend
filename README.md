# LOCAL MUSIC MANAGER - API

API backend that lets you search for songs on your computer, find matches and add them to custom YouTube Music playlists.

The app uses the library [ytmusicapi](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to automate interactions with YouTube Music.

## Necessary Installations

### Create environment (Optional):

```bash
virtualenv env
```

### Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Create a environment file:

Create a file called `.env` based on file `.env.example`

### To configure the authentication on Google

- Sign in or create an account in [Google Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Create a new project
- Go to "APIs & Services" product
- Select "Credentials"
- Create "OAuth client ID" credentials, and select "Web Application"
- Add "Authorized JavaScript origins" like "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
- Add "Authorized redirect URIs" like "https://davidgarzonv.github.io/local-music-manager-auth"

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

**Disable environment:**

```bash
deactivate
```

## To run the application:

```bash
py entrypoint.py
```

## Configure the application

- Configuration is required before using the api

1. Call the endpoint `api/v1/auth/configure` with the configured data created in the previous step.
2. Test any endpoint that uses Youtube Music, like "Get Playlists"
3. If the process was successful you will be able to see the answer with the playlists of your Youtube Music profile.

### API Documentation

[Swagger documentation](docs/collection.swagger.yaml)

## Package the application into an executable:

- Update the `.env` changing the environment for `production`

Execute the command:

```bash
pyinstaller entrypoint.spec --clean
```

The application will be located at: `dist/entrypoint/localmusicmanager.exe`
- It is important to keep the `_internal` folder along with the executable for it's use.

A little snippet to get the session values generated by Google, needed for the endpoint (api/v1/auth/session):

```javascript
// Create a URL object
const parsedUrl = new URL(window.location.href);

// Get the search parameters
const params = parsedUrl.searchParams;

// Retrieve the state and code
const state = params.get('state');
const code = params.get('code');

console.log({ state, code });
```
